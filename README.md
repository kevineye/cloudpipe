### Features

 - Unlike most HTTP clients, the input and output are streamed
 - Reading can start before writing (and will wait for a writer).
 - Reading will start from the beginning of the file and will continue to stream until all writers disconnect.
 - Multiple clients can read at the same time.
 - Files are stored and can be re-streamed.
